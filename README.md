# Terser Demo

This project demonstrates how to use [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) for JavaScript minification. It provides examples of both simple code minification and file-based minification, showcasing how to minify JavaScript code using Terser.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaseMax/terser-demo.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd terser-demo
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

**Minifying Inline Code**

In the code.js file, you can find an example of how to minify a block of JavaScript code using Terser. Run the script to see the minified version of the provided code.

**Minifying Files**

In the file.js file, thereâ€™s an example of how to read a JavaScript file (example-code.txt.js), minify it, and save the result to another file (example-code.js). This demonstrates how to use Terser for file-based minification.

**Minifying Code with Source Maps**

The test.js file shows how to minify JavaScript code while generating a source map. This can be useful for debugging and maintaining the connection between the minified code and the original source code.
